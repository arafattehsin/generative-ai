# ü§ø Deep dive with Agentic AI (Beginners to Intermediate)

`Author: Arafat Tehsin`

Imagine having a team of specialised AI assistants in your organisation - one that expertly handles customer support tickets, another that analyses critical business data and a third that streamlines employee onboarding. Now imagine them working together seamlessly to solve complex business challenges while reducing response times and improving accuracy.

Just like a modern enterprise where different departments collaborate to achieve business goals, these AI agents combine their specialised capabilities to handle complex workflows. Think of how a new employee request moves through HR, IT, and Finance departments - now envision AI agents orchestrating this entire process automatically, from generating documentation to setting up system access and creating training plans. They're coming, sooner than you think. üöÄ

The assumption is that you're already equipped with the information on how to work with the Polyglot Notebooks. If you have not worked with them in the past then I'd recommend you to try `getting-started.ipynb` notebook within this repo.

string azureOpenAIKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AOI_KEY_SWDN");

üì∞ Imagine a bustling newsroom, where a top reporter to cover a major story. The Kernel is the editor-in-chief, managing experts from Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Ollama. Each "reporter" has a unique specialty: Azure OpenAI may handle in-depth investigations, Google Gemini excels at rapid fact-checking, and Ollama covers insightful analysis. Under the Kernel's direction, these specialists work in harmony, gathering and piecing together information to create a comprehensive, high-impact story‚Äîdelivering complex insights with precision and clarity, just like a well-run newsroom.

_I will leave this example for you to create at the end._ üòâ

## Utility Functions for Agent Interaction üß∞

This provides utility functions to streamline interactions with AI Agents. Key functionalities include serializing objects to JSON (AsJson), formatting and displaying agent chat messages (WriteAgentChatMessage), invoking agents with user input and processing responses (InvokeAgentAsync).

This also contains an additional method for creating a kernel which will be used quite often below.

Imagine you‚Äôre running a customer service center üìû, where each inquiry is handled by a specialised agent. Here, `weatherAgent` is your dedicated "Weather Expert" üå¶Ô∏è, trained specifically to answer all weather-related questions. The `Kernel` acts as the expert‚Äôs support system üõ†Ô∏è, ensuring every response aligns with the latest standards and practices.

When a customer asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather in Seattle?‚Äù üåßÔ∏è, `InvokeAgentAsync` is like the call center operator üë©‚Äçüíª, routing the query to the Weather Expert, who quickly pulls up a ready-made response. The `ChatHistory` serves as a record book üìú, maintaining continuity in case the customer has follow-up questions. With this setup, you can handle weather inquiries smoothly, with the expert agent delivering responses that feel natural and conversational üåà.

## Kitchen Assistant üçΩÔ∏è

Think of this as building a smart kitchen assistant ü§ñ, where an agent has its own specialty. The `foodAgent` is like a personalized meal planner üë©‚Äçüç≥, who considers the current weather üå¶Ô∏è and time of day ‚è∞ to suggest the perfect dish. The `foodAgentKernel` serves as the central system in the kitchen, and you‚Äôve just enhanced it by adding plugins: the `TimePlugin` üïí helps the agent track the time of day, while the `FoodPlugin` üçï provides detailed ingredient lists and recipes.

When you ask, ‚ÄúWhat should I eat right now?‚Äù ü•ò, `InvokeAgentAsync` sends your request to the Food Agent, who now has all the context to make a smart recommendation. The agent ensures all meal suggestions are halal or vegetarian üå±, and even provides the recipe to go along with the dish. The `ChatHistory` keeps track of your culinary conversation üç¥, so you can ask follow-up questions and get new suggestions. With the added plugins, the assistant is ready to guide you through tasty and thoughtful meal choices at any time!

## Tour Planner üß≥‚úàÔ∏è

Think of this as setting up a travel agency with two highly specialised agents. The **Travel Planner Agent** is like an expert trip organizer, focused on creating concise, detailed itineraries that match the user‚Äôs preferences. It considers everything from destinations to accommodations and calculates the total budget üí∏, ensuring every detail is accounted for without unnecessary explanation.

Then, we have the **Budget Advisor Agent**, who acts as the financial guardian üí∞, analysing the travel plan and ensuring it stays within the specified budget. If the plan exceeds the user‚Äôs budget, the agent rejects it with a firm "no" üö´, but if it fits, it gives a confident "yes" ‚úÖ. Both agents work in tandem under the coordination of the `AgentGroupChat`, which keeps the conversation flowing smoothly, ensuring both the travel plan and budget are aligned. This system is like a well-oiled machine, where the **Travel Planner** creates the plan, and the **Budget Advisor** ensures it‚Äôs financially feasible, with everything wrapped up in a neat, efficient process.

## Concierge Service üè®üß≥

A service that can plan a personalized day trip for you, covering everything from weather forecasts üå§Ô∏è to food choices üçΩÔ∏è, travel activities üó∫Ô∏è, and budget approvals üíµ. The system consists of multiple agents working in harmony, each playing a specialized role, like a team of experts collaborating to deliver the best experience.

The **Weather Agent** starts the process, providing a quick, concise weather update üå°Ô∏è. The **Food Agent** follows up with food suggestions based on the weather and time of day üåûüç≤, while the **Travel Agent** recommends activities that match the conditions, ensuring an exciting itinerary ‚ú®. Finally, the **Concierge Agent** steps in to review the whole plan, ensuring everything fits together perfectly, checking for consistency in weather, food, and travel plans üîç. The entire system is designed to dynamically select which agent responds next, using a custom selection strategy üß†, and will terminate the process once the Concierge Agent approves the plan üëç or rejects it with a "no" üëé. The `AgentGroupChat` orchestrates all this, making sure every agent does their job in sequence until the plan is finalized.

With this setup, you can chat with the system, asking for a day plan in any city, and the agents will work together seamlessly to provide a travel plan that is both enjoyable and feasible, tailored to your preferences and budget!

# Copilot Studio Agents with Semantic Kernel

Imagine you‚Äôre running a community helpdesk for outdoor adventurers üèûÔ∏è, where every question is handled by a specialist agent. In this setup, CopilotStudioAgent is your ‚ÄúOutdoor Explorer‚Äù ü•æ an expert guide trained to answer all things hiking, from gentle nature walks to advanced mountain treks.

Another Semantic Kernel agent can like the operations manager üéõÔ∏è, making sure every inquiry is routed to the right expert and that responses always reflect the latest advice and best practices.

When someone asks, ‚ÄúWhat types of hiking activities do you help with?‚Äù üó∫Ô∏è, InvokeAgentAsync is your trusty dispatcher üö¶, sending the question directly to the Outdoor Explorer, who instantly shares a tailored, conversational answer. 

With this approach, your SK-powered application delivers seamless, expert-level advice for outdoor activities, all by connecting to the specialised knowledge already built into your Copilot Studio agent üå≤‚ú®.
