    "## üî® üß† AI Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "AI plugins are like a set of instructions or tasks that your application can perform. You can think of them as a recipe book for your application. Each recipe (or plugin) contains a list of ingredients (or functions) and steps (or triggers and actions) that your application can use to accomplish a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you're building a chatbot and you want it to be able to answer questions about the weather. You could create a plugin that contains a function for fetching the current weather data from a weather API and another function for formatting that data into a user-friendly message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are the fundamental building blocks of Semantic Kernel and can interoperate with plugins in ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365. With plugins, you can encapsulate capabilities into a single unit of functionality that can then be run by the kernel. Plugins can consist of both native code and requests to AI services via prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means any plugins you build can be exported so they are usable in ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365. This allows you to increase the reach of your AI capabilities without rewriting code. It also means that plugins built for ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365 can be imported into Semantic Kernel seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üëÇ üó£Ô∏è Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Prompts (or Prompt Functions) as the individual steps in a recipe. Each step (or function) tells your application what to do and how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a chatbot and you want it to be able to answer questions about the weather so you can plan your beach trip. One of your prompts might be a step that fetches the current weather data from a weather API. Another prompt might be a step that takes that weather data and recommend the ideal timings for the beach based upon the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are used in plugins, which are like the full recipes in your recipe book. Each plugin can contain multiple prompts and each prompt can be triggered by certain events or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you‚Äôre building an application and you want it to have some cool AI features, Prompts give you the tools to do that. They‚Äôre like the individual steps that make up your app's recipe for success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üé¨ üîç ‚úçÔ∏è Native Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Native Functions in Semantic Kernel as the kitchen tools you use when following a recipe. These could be things like a blender, an oven or a knife. They‚Äôre the tools that allow you to interact with your ingredients (data) and transform them in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a chatbot and one of your recipes (plugins) is for baking a cake. One of your steps (Prompts) might be to mix the ingredients together (combine data), but you can‚Äôt do that with your hands. You need a tool (Native Function) like a blender.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you could create a Native Function that takes your ingredients (data), uses the blender (performs an operation on the data) and returns a cake batter (the result of the operation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in cooking, having the right tools can make all the difference. That‚Äôs why Semantic Kernel allows you to create your own Native Functions. So, whether you‚Äôre baking a cake or building an application, you‚Äôll always have the tools you need to get the job done!"

    "\n",
    "Computers don‚Äôt understand words and sentences the way humans do. So, we need a way to convert our text data into a numerical format that a computer can work with. That‚Äôs where embeddings come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding takes a word or a piece of text and maps it to a high-dimensional vector of real numbers. The interesting part is that these vectors are created in such a way that words with similar meanings are placed close together in this high-dimensional space. This allows the machine learning model to understand the semantic similarity between different words or pieces of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the words ‚Äúcat‚Äù and ‚Äúkitten‚Äù would be mapped to vectors that are close together in the embedding space, because they have similar meanings. On the other hand, the words ‚Äúcat‚Äù and ‚Äúcar‚Äù would be mapped to vectors that are further apart, because they are semantically different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìê Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity is a way of comparing two things, but instead of comparing them directly, we compare the direction they‚Äôre heading. Imagine you and your friend are going on a trip. You‚Äôre starting from the same place but you might not be going to the same destination. The cosine similarity is a measure of how similar your destinations are based on the direction you‚Äôre heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of vectors (which you can think of as arrows pointing from one point to another), the cosine similarity is calculated by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. If the vectors are pointing in exactly the same direction, the angle between them is 0 degrees and their cosine similarity is 1. If they‚Äôre pointing in completely opposite directions, the angle is 180 degrees and their cosine similarity is -1. If they‚Äôre at right angles to each other (90 degrees), their cosine similarity is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming or data science, we often use cosine similarity to compare different pieces of data. For example, if we have two documents and we want to see how similar they are, we can represent each document as a vector (where each dimension corresponds to a word, and the value in that dimension corresponds to how often that word appears in the document), and then calculate the cosine similarity between these two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So what's the big deal here? \n",
    "\n",
    "Relax. Imagine you're working in a large enterprise with so many documents and you want to look out for a specific policy, it's going to be super difficult for you to look out for them. Even if you try to organise them quite well, you'd stil need good time to identify on which page that particular policy is written. Hence, too much of a manual work. Scenarios like these are common but with the help of above concepts, these problems can be solved efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have tried to create a visual riddle on the basis of the country name. You choose the country name, it generates a landmark. Then it asks you to define this landmark. If your definition of the generated landmark is similar to what is generated by AI then you get the higher cosine value, hence you win. üèÜ\n",

    "## üìù Planners \n",
    "\n",
    "Planners are a set of tools that allow developers to automatically orchestrate AI functions. They use AI to mix-and-match the plugins registered in the kernel so that it can recombine them into a series of steps that complete a goal. This is a powerful concept because it allows you to create atomic functions that can be used in ways that you as a developer may not have thought of. For example, if you had task and calendar event plugins, planner could combine them to create workflows like \"remind me to buy milk when I go to the store\" or \"remind me to call my mom tomorrow\" without you explicitly having to write code for those scenarios. The planners can optimiSe the number of functions you can call per LLM request, which can save both time and money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel Planners include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handlebars Planner**: A planner that uses Handlebars syntax to generate a plan. The benefit of this is that it supports loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function Calling Stepwise Planner**: A planner that adds some additional reasoning at the beginning of the plan generation to improve the reliability of function calling. This is also called as ReAct methodology. "
