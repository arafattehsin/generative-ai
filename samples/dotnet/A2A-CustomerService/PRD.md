2. **Transparent** - Real-time visibility into agent interactions and decision-making processes  
3. **Efficient** - Streamlined workflows that showcase automated routing and collaborative problem-solving

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Demonstrates sophisticated multi-agent coordination while maintaining an accessible interface for understanding the A2A workflow

## Essential Features

### Customer Ticket Submission
- **Functionality**: Form for customers to submit support requests with automatic categorization
- **Purpose**: Entry point that triggers the multi-agent workflow demonstration
- **Trigger**: Customer clicks "Submit Support Request" after filling form
- **Progression**: Form submission → Front Desk Agent receives → Categorization → Agent routing → Response aggregation → Customer notification
- **Success criteria**: Ticket created with unique ID, customer receives confirmation, agents begin processing

### Real-Time Agent Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Live view of all three agents (Front Desk, Billing, Tech Support) with their current activities
- **Purpose**: Visualize the A2A communication and collaborative problem-solving in action
- **Trigger**: Automatically updates when tickets are submitted or agent states change
- **Progression**: Agent receives assignment → Status updates → Processing → Response generation → Coordination with other agents
- **Success criteria**: Each agent shows relevant status, progress indicators work, inter-agent messages display

### Intelligent Ticket Routing
- **Functionality**: Front Desk Agent analyzes tickets using AI and routes to appropriate specialist agents
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate smart categorization and multi-agent coordination capabilities
- **Trigger**: New ticket submission triggers analysis and routing logic
- **Progression**: Ticket analysis → Category detection → Multi-agent assignment → Parallel processing → Response coordination
- **Success criteria**: Correct agents assigned based on ticket content, routing decisions explained, multiple agents can work simultaneously

### Agent Response Aggregation
- **Functionality**: Front Desk Agent collects and synthesizes responses from specialist agents into unified customer reply
- **Purpose**: Show how A2A enables comprehensive, coordinated customer service
- **Trigger**: All assigned agents complete their analysis and submit responses
- **Progression**: Individual agent responses → Front Desk aggregation → Unified response generation → Customer delivery
- **Success criteria**: Customer receives single, coherent response addressing all aspects of their issue

## Edge Case Handling
- **Single-category tickets**: Route to appropriate specialist only, no aggregation needed
- **Unclear requests**: Front Desk Agent requests clarification before routing
- **Agent unavailable**: System shows agent status and queues requests appropriately
- **Timeout scenarios**: Agents have processing time limits with visible countdowns
- **Conflicting responses**: Front Desk Agent reconciles differences and notes discrepancies

## Design Direction
The interface should feel like a modern enterprise customer service platform - professional yet approachable, with clean lines and purposeful use of space that emphasizes the sophisticated AI coordination happening behind the scenes.
