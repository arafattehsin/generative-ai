# SLA Policy (Supply Chain)

## Priority Targets

| Service Tier | On-Time SLA | Breach Threshold | Financial Penalty Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platinum | 98.5% | < 97% | Immediate |
| Gold | 97% | < 95% | Within 24 hours |
| Standard | 95% | < 93% | Weekly review |

## Breach Risk Guidelines

- If projected delay exceeds 12 hours for Platinum, classify as at least `high`.
- If delay exceeds 24 hours with perishable goods, classify as `critical` unless mitigated.
- If at-risk orders exceed 25% of open orders, raise one severity tier.

## Communication Expectations

- Customer-facing communication must be issued within 30 minutes for `critical` and 60 minutes for `high` incidents.
- Internal leadership update cadence:
  - `critical`: every 30 minutes
  - `high`: every 2 hours
  - `medium`: twice per day
