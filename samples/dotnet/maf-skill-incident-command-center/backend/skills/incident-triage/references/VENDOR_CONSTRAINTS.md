# Vendor Constraints & Recovery Rules

## Constraint Types

- **Capacity constraints**: supplier cannot increase throughput for 3-10 days.
- **Transport constraints**: carrier schedule or lane capacity reduced.
- **Compliance constraints**: substitutions require approval and documentation.

## Recovery Guidelines

- Prefer substitution suppliers for non-regulated components.
- For regulated packaging or food/pharma logistics, substitutions require quality sign-off.
- Premium freight usage above 12% budget uplift needs director approval.
- For perishable goods, prioritize spoilage prevention over margin preservation.

## Risk Notes

- Cross-border disruptions can amplify delay variance by 1.8x.
- Multi-vendor handoff points increase failure probability during active disruptions.
