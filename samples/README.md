# Samples
This is a playground where we experiment with the building blocks of Generative AI, showcasing its versatility and power.

## .NET
In this section, you’ll find a collection of samples that serve as blueprints for building applications with Azure OpenAI, Semantic Kernel, and other technologies. Each sample is like a blueprint, guiding you through the process of constructing your own Generative AI applications. Whether you’re a seasoned .NET developer or just starting out, these samples will provide you with practical insights and hands-on experience.

## Python (💡 may get here soon)
This is where we assemble our toolkit for Generative AI. From Azure OpenAI to Semantic Kernel, these samples demonstrate how Python can be used to create powerful and complex applications in the realm of Generative AI.

The samples directory is more than just a collection of files; it’s a workshop that brings Generative AI to life. So come on in, roll up your sleeves, and start building. 🧑‍💻
