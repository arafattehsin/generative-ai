# Samples

This is a playground where we experiment with the building blocks of Generative AI, showcasing its versatility and power.

## .NET

In this section, you'll find a collection of samples that serve as blueprints for building applications with Azure OpenAI, Semantic Kernel, and other technologies. Each sample is like a blueprint, guiding you through the process of constructing your own Generative AI applications. Whether you're a seasoned .NET developer or just starting out, these samples will provide you with practical insights and hands-on experience.
